# Pointer Arithmetic

Create a C program that demonstrates pointer arithmetic on strings.

1. Retrieve a string from `stdin`. Enter the number of characters to skip. Print the string without the skipped characters.

`brown fox`

`2`

`bwf`

(Bonus) Using a pointer to the end of a string (the null), print the string in reverse.
